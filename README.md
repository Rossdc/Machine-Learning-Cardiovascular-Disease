# Machine-Learning-Cardiovascular-Disease
A decision tree was created to determine if Cardiovascular Disease could be reliably determined based on the data to hand, and if so, what variables were most significant. This was pruned using the best complexity parameter and a model developed to measure results via a confusion matrix. Training and Test data was created to enable this, with the random forest method used to confirm observations. Measures such as ROC and KS statistic were also analyzed.

The report can be found in the files section along with R code used for analysis, and the csv file with which this analysis was conducted on.
